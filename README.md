## Technical Highlights
- The image search feature utilized the Google Image Search API, allowing users to search with images. The Google Custom Search API was also used to enable keyword searches in English and Chinese.
- Utilized the Apple Vision framework to achieve the text recognition feature by extracting text from images and allowing users to copy and paste the text elsewhere or translate the text.
- Used MVC architectural pattern to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.
- The entire App is developed in full coding layout.
- Used Firebase FireStore to store and retrieve data.
- Implemented Apple Sign-In SDK and Google Sign-In SDK to provide logins as well as Firebase Authentication for authenticating user logins and storing credentials.
